As a beginner, you’ll want to use barbells, dumbbells, cables, and your own bodyweight—the full range of gym implements, basically—to challenge your muscles not only with varying degrees of weight but also different stabilization demands, ranges of motion, and levels of difficulty.",
    description2:
      "During the workout, rest 90 seconds between exercises and 60 seconds between sets. Start off with lightweight dumbbells, no or very little weight on the barbell, and light weight on the cables. Focus on perfecting the movements before adding weight.",
